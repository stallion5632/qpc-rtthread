        This option enables the use of RT-Thread memory pool (rt_mempool)
        as the backend for QP/C event pools, providing zero-intrusion
        integration between RT-Thread and QP/C memory management.

        - Usage tracking (current and peak memory allocation)
        - Debug output during allocation/free operations
        - Memory statistics functions
